# To-Do-For-Procrastinators
A Procrastinator's To-Do App

This android app is meant to help people combat procrastinism. If you have a lot of time left to do a certain task but you don't want to leave it for until the last-minute, 
you can schedule the to-do in the app and then let the app do the rest. If you forget the original deadline that's even better. This app will prepone the deadline 
by creating a virtual one for you when you are not using your phone. This app will also let you know when less than a day is remaining and when less than 2 hours are 
remaining for virtual deadline of the task. 

For some tasks where you don't want the deadline to be preponed, you can just turn off the switch that says 'virtual deadline enabled'.

Virtual Deadline app:

- makes use of Viewmodel, Firebase Job Dispatcher, Room ORM etc.

- lets you schedule your tasks and then without you even noticing, secretly creates a virtual deadline for each of your tasks. (Check out the app screenshots for more information)

- Prepones the deadline by creating a virtual one for you when you are not using your phone. It just creates a suitable virtual deadline - neither too far nor too near the original deadline, just the perfect one.

- lets you know when less than a day is remaining for each task's virtual deadline to end and again lets you know when less than two hours are remaining. This way you are constantly motivated to get your tasks done much before the original deadline.

- color-codes the tasks: grey is for past tasks, dark green is for upcoming tasks, and light green is for future tasks (please see the screenshots).

- does not create virtual deadlines for tasks when not needed. You just need to turn off the switch that says 'virtual deadline enabled' (please see the screenshots).
