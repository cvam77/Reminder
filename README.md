# To-Do-For-Procrastinators
A Procrastinator's To-Do App

This android app is meant to help people combat procrastinism. If you have a lot of time left to do a certain task but you don't want to leave it for until the last-minute, 
you can schedule the to-do in the app and then let the app do the rest. If you forget the original deadline that's even better. This app will prepone the deadline 
by creating a virtual one for you when you are not using your phone. This app will also let you know when less than a day is remaining and when less than 2 hours are 
remaining for virtual deadline of the task. 

For some tasks where you don't want the deadline to be preponed, you can just turn off the switch that says 'virtual deadline enabled'.
